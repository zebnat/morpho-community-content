## How to upload content (For content manager contributors)

Content should be placed under the folder `content`

Tree structure is as follows:

`content/MacrojuegosUserName/AvatarName/full.jpg` 
327x505px jpg image. Should be the full sized avatar image.

`content/MacrojuegosUserName/AvatarName/normal.jpg`
105x105px jpg image. This is the 1:1 avatar shown with focus on the face, or something similar to a face (depends on the avatar).

`content/MacrojuegosUserName/AvatarName/little.jpg`
57x57 jpg image. This should be the same as normal.jpg, but resized to 57x57
